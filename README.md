Project Under Construction

1. Here above is the succesful detection of road lanes with video output.
2. Road Lane is shown by Green dotted line covering the lane line 
3. Road edge her is shown by red line over it.
   note: (i) Even the cars are detected by the lane detection.
         (ii) Need to make a different symbol and transparent and efficient detection of cars in lane.
         (iii) Lane changes are also detected somehow. Need to correct that.

To be continued...
